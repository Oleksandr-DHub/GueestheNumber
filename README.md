Guess the Number

About

This is a simple Python program. The computer picks a random number, and the player has to guess it. The program gives hints like "too high" or "too low" until the player guesses the correct number.

How It Works:

1) The computer randomly chooses a number.

2) The player types a guess.

3) The program tells if the guess is:

Too high

Too low

Correct

4) The game ends when the player guesses the number.

Example:

Program: "Guess a number between 1 and 100:"

Player: "50"

Program: "Too high!"

Player: "20"

Program: "Too low!"

Player: "36"

Program: "Correct! You win!"

What I Learned:

1) How to use random numbers in Python.

2) How to check if a guess is right or wrong.

3) How to use loops to keep the game going.
